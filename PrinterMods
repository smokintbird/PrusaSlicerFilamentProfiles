Reprinting with a different plastic hardly qualifies as a modification, however any deviations needed to be noted.

Original Prusa i3 Mk3s+
  Re-printed all plastic parts
    Y-Axis Rod holders (needed more flex in the parts)
      Prusament Polycarbonate Blend (Grey)
    Everything else
      Prusament Carbon Fiber Polycarbonate Blend
      
  Changed out all linear bearings for the higher end Japanese made bearings
    No noticable differences after replacement (Just for longevity's sake)
