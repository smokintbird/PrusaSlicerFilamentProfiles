# PrusaSlicerFilamentProfiles
Collection of material profiles for PrusaSlicer

I was tired of re-creating all of my filament profiles for each computer or for each Beta version, so this will serve as a repository of filament profiles that can be copied into the "C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\PrusaSlicer\filament" or "C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\PrusaSlicer-beta\filament" directories in Windows.

These profiles are NOT expected to be "fully tuned" profiles; they have been configured using the manufacturer's Technical Data Sheets, and should work for ANY printer capable of the temperatures required.

I have TESTED each profile on my mostly stock Prusa i3 Mk3s+ and each profile has provided functional parts.  That being said, I'm certain some printer specific fine tuning could yield even better results.
