# PrusaSlicerFilamentProfiles
Collection of material profiles for PrusaSlicer

I was tired of re-creating all of my filament profiles for each computer or for each Beta version, so this will serve as a repository of filament profiles (.ini files) that can be copied into the "C:\Users\\%username%\AppData\Roaming\PrusaSlicer\filament" or "C:\Users\\%username%\AppData\Roaming\PrusaSlicer-beta\filament" directories in Windows.

These profiles are NOT expected to be "fully tuned" profiles; they have been configured using the Technical Data Sheets provided by each manufacturer, and should work for ANY printer capable of the temperatures required by the material.

I have TESTED each profile on my mostly stock Prusa i3 Mk3s+, and produced functional parts from each profile before uploading.  That being said, I'm certain some printer specific fine tuning could yield even better results.
